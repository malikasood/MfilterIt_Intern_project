769,Great! I love all the safety features the car has. The black rims on the SR package really makes this car stands out. Love my choice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
770,"I had a '22 Maxima SV as a rental in South Florida and I feel qualified to write a review as I put 1500 miles on it in the course of 4 days (due to my flight being cancelled I had to drive it back to ATL). As an avid car enthusiast, I was thoroughly impressed with the Maxima. It was reasonably comfortable while still retaining an ounce of athleticism, the 3.5 V6 was super smooth and even made a nice growl upon heavy acceleration, and the CVT isn't actually that bad (works great in stop and go traffic). The SV trim has everything you would want feature wise and the Apple Car Play worked fantastic. I will say the fit and finish is great for a normal car brand, however not the best stacked up to brands such as Lexus, BMW, etc. The adaptive cruise worked pretty decent however after daily driving a Model 3, it would have been nice to have some sort of lane centering feature. I also averaged 28 MPG and I wasn't taking it easy (80 MPH+) which was very impressive. The Maxima is a super solid premium sedan contender, still looks very stylish, has plenty of space, performs well in the city and on the highway, and overall is a super honest car.

771,This car drove just like a dream and she really loves it recommended with over 300 horsepower it will go classy look call  fun to drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
772,I had owned  a MAXIMA in the 80's and when I saw the 2021 model I knew I had to have it! It is so fun to drive and the numerous safety features help keep me focused. Nissan definitely covered all their bases with this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
773,"This car meets all of our needs as it was purchased for my wife as a Birthday Gift.  The car has plenty of leg room for the Front Passenger (Me), but not so much for the Driver, and makes the Driver feel closed in as the design of the console hits the Drivers Knee.  However, this car has an Exceptional ride, and very comfortable on the road.  With that said, the seats are comfortable, and is loaded with lots of technology (too much tech for older citizens).   It is well constructed, and is quiet, and smooth seamless shifts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
774,The only negative is the backseat leg room is small. The car is sporty and fun to drive. The infotainment options are excellent. The speed is a plus!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
